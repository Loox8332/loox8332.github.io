Developed Python-based end-to-end data pipelines to clean, validate, and analyse spatial data, ensuring temporal consistency across frames. Designed automated performance metrics to evaluate mapping accuracy, coverage efficiency, and overall system reliability. Ongoing work focuses on extending the system toward fully autonomous mapping with improved coverage strategies and higher reconstruction accuracy.","github","productivity scheduler","Designed and developed a calendar-based productivity planner to improve task prioritisation, time management, and long-term goal tracking. The system integrates structured scheduling with higher-level planning and uses APIs to synchronise calendar data and automate event handling.  Built with a focus on usability and scalability, applying system optimisation and data-driven iteration to support modular task blocks, deadline visualisation, progress tracking, and review cycles.","6 dof manipulator","To enhance my software and coding related skills, I worked on modelling a 6 DOF robotic manipulator with the goal of local environment mapping and object control. This project allowed me to develop my knowledge surrounding ROS and URDF while also teaching me how to code in C++ and Java. In addition to this, my experience working collaboratively with git version control gave me an opportunity to demonstrate adaptability and flexibility working with advanced projects. Ultimately, I was unable to create any prototypes of my works due to the high cost involved in development.","royal mint project","As part of a nominated project with The Royal Mint, I led a research-focused team that rediscovered a lost 17th-century coin manufacturing technique. Some key aspects of my role included writing a detailed research article that examined the evolution of raised edge coin manufacturing, collaborating with scholars, and exploring new research opportunities for The Royal Mint. Additionally, I guided a team of five in designing and creating a functional prototype of this important method used in British coin production. This project enhanced my research abilities and strengthened my skills in leadership, historical investigation, and collaborative innovation.","⬅","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/projects"}}
